#Online Shopping Website
Made using HTML, CSS, PHP & MySQL

## Installation
To run, it basically needs a WAMP/LAMP/MAMP Server. <br><br>
For creating the databases, first run the "create_db&table.php" script and then run the "create_bankdb.php" script. These files collectively  will create a MySQL database named "shopping" & the necessary tables within.<br><br>
In case you have a password for your database, then please change the Password variables in the above 2 files and also the "db.php" as all other files in the project use the "db.php" file for database connection.<br><br>
The login ID & password for the Administrator & Courier console have been hard-coded in to the scripts. Admin details can be found at line 42 of "admin_login.php" & Courier details can be found at line 42 of "cou_login.php"
